**ABOUT THE PROCESS**

We must to be sure our NFTs are redeeming by their rightful owners.  

:link: → The initial verification process will allow us to link your current Discord account with your Tezos address. 
:ok_hand: → You only need to verify once, unless you use another Discord account, or another wallet.    
:eye_in_speech_bubble: → When you'll send a request for an NFT to be redeemed—and then when the redeeming session starts—our bot Talos will check ownership of the specific Token. 

**STEPS**

The procedure is simple and safe.
:point_right:  → Type `/start` followed by your Tezos public address
:ladder: → Follow the steps
:tada: → Once you get a confirmation message, you're all set!  

**FAQ**

:thinking: *Can I have multiple wallets linked to one Discord account?* 
Yes, you can. Repeat the verification procedure for each wallet.

:face_with_raised_eyebrow: *Can I link my wallet(s) to another Discord account?*
